# Matrix Core

A minimal yet comprehensive implementation of core matrix operations in Python. This folder is part of a larger linear algebra repository and is designed for educational and conceptual exploration of fundamental matrix algorithms, focusing on clarity and algorithmic depth.

## ðŸ“¦ Overview
This folder provides a Python-based foundation for matrix and vector operations, implemented from first principles without reliance on external numerical libraries. It emphasizes the mechanics behind common linear algebra routines.

## âœ¨ Features
- Matrix addition and subtraction
- Scalar and matrix multiplication
- Dot product (vector and matrix)
- Transposition
- Identity matrix creation
- Basic error handling for dimension checks
